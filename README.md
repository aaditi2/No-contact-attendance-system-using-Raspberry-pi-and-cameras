# No-contact-attendance-system-using-Raspberry-pi-and-cameras
Innovative system designed by using Raspberry Pi &amp; python to recognize and detect faces, allowing for automated attendance marking. When a student's face 
matched our dataset, the system seamlessly marked their attendance and sent notifications to the Head of the Dept. and the professor.
